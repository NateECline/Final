        Hello any and everybody! My name is Nathan Cline and I am 27 years young. I have always dreamed of being a developer but thought it was always to hard to learn. After having my son I decided I wanted to pursue this path and jumped in.
        I can say it was one of the best decisions of my life! I now have a new passion for coding and learning other languages.
